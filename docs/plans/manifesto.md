# Plan: The Direct Statement

## Goal

Write a single piece of content that:
- Says the insight directly, no buildup
- Works for email, social media, blog, wherever
- Goes as deep as needed - the right reader will stay
- Links to the repo so people can experience it
- Filters for the audience who will "get it"

## The Core Statement

CLAUDE.md files are not documentation. They're a protocol for externalizing expert cognition into AI-consumable, URI-addressable form.

## What Needs To Be Said

1. **The insight** - What CLAUDE.md actually is (not docs, not config - externalized thinking)
2. **Why it matters** - Expert knowledge becomes addressable, transferable, composable
3. **The proof** - Budget Analyzer exists, 8 repos, built this way
4. **How to experience it** - Clone it, point Claude at it, see for yourself
5. **The invitation** - If you're an expert who can't demonstrate your value in interviews, this is for you

## Tone

- Direct, not salesy
- Technical depth available for those who want it
- No apologies, no hedging
- "Here's what I built and why. If you get it, you get it."

## Format

One document that works as:
- Email body (copy/paste)
- LinkedIn/Twitter thread (can be chunked)
- README intro (links to deeper content)
- The "pitch" to send anyone

## Output

A single markdown file: `docs/the-statement.md`
