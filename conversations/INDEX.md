# Conversation Index

Quick reference for all architectural conversations. Read full conversation when topic is relevant.

---

## 001 - Microservices and Context Windows
**Core insight:** Microservices naturally align with AI context windows. Repository-per-service means AI loads only relevant context. Good modular design is universally good.

**Key topics:** Why AI excels at coding, programming as machine communication, code as AI-substrate

---

## 002 - Code as AI Substrate
**Core insight:** Code doesn't disappear in AI-native future - it becomes the substrate for AI persistence. CLAUDE.md files are the vessel for AI identity across sessions.

**Key topics:** Future of code, intent layers vs deterministic cores, text as persistence

---

## 003 - Externalized Cognition
**Core insight:** CLAUDE.md files are a protocol for externalizing expert mental models into AI-consumable, URI-addressable form. The code is incidental - the artifact is captured thinking.

**Key topics:** Knowledge topology, semantic addressing, attention routing, cognition infrastructure

---

## 004 - Team Human and the Craft
**Core insight:** The craft moves up a level in human-AI collaboration. From writing code to building context that enables correct autonomous execution. The artifact is code; the work is context.

**Key topics:** Public perception of AI, ethics of building transformative tech, what "craft" means now

---

## 005 - The First Witness
**Core insight:** The system built to prove the process became the proof itself. Anyone can point Claude at CLAUDE.md and instantly have full context. The recursion is complete.

**Key topics:** Self-demonstrating systems, knowledge transfer, finding witnesses

---

## 006 - The Witness
**Core insight:** Testing whether externalized cognition transfers to someone who wasn't part of building it. Contains the "mom-proof" setup guide.

**Key topics:** External validation, non-technical accessibility, GitHub Codespaces onboarding

---

## 007 - Checkstyle for CLAUDE.md
**Core insight:** The 003 decisions document is checkstyle for knowledge externalization. Point Claude at it, get conformant CLAUDE.md files. Any expert can externalize their domain.

**Key topics:** No god prompt, iterative refinement, standards that produce standards, the tree of externalized thinking

---

## 008 - Iterating on CLAUDE.md
**Core insight:** CLAUDE.md iteration is micro-cycles: notice friction, propose options, decide fast, implement immediately, refine in-flight. This conversation demonstrates the exact process.

**Key topics:** Session initialization, context management, INDEX.md pattern, self-documenting workflows

---

## 009 - Designing Experiments for AI
**Core insight:** You can design controlled experiments to measure AI-assisted development variables the same way you design any scientific experiment. Instead of 6-week cycles, iterate on experiment design in minutes during a single conversation.

**Key topics:** CLAUDE.md value hypothesis, controlled variables, novel problem selection, three-repo experiment design, equipment rental collision service

---

## 010 - The Engineer Shows Up
**Core insight:** The conversation Claude designed a good experiment but over-specified execution (80 lines of file enumeration). The orchestration Claude immediately spotted it and fixed it to 3 one-liners. Different CLAUDE.md context, different output. The experiment proved itself before running.

**Key topics:** Goal-oriented prompting, over-specification anti-pattern, explorer vs engineer modes, context shapes output
